## Directory that contains all the tp for the ITR course of the year 2022.

## TP1 
[project description]
Implement an application consisting of a triage process and multiple processes that submit arrays to this one. The sent arrays can contain a maximum of 65,536 signed integers. A submission process starts by generating an array of signed integers before submitting it to the sorting process. When he finished work, the triage process signals the process that submitted the array that its contents have been processed. The process of submit verifies that its array is indeed sorted and displays a feedback in the terminal stating the size of the array as well as its minimum element.

## TP2
